Some of my solutions to miscellanous puzzles

So it seems it's pretty common to have a rep of solved CF questions and such. And since I like seeing my GitHub heatmap turn green, I'll do it too. Solutions ofttimes will be inefficient, wrong, incomplete, unoriginal, etc. This is not intended to be a solution manual, more of a record of my progress.
